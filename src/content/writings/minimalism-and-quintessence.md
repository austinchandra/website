What is *minimalism*?
It is not philosophy—but a charade.
The idea of less and less—merely romanticizes poverty.

"Look how poor, how noble!"

To like—and to discard.
How vain!

Like a Nazi.
"There shall be *one* race!"

Do you like Hitler?
Please explain...

No.
I like *quintessence*.

One idea—to represent *all*.

My hero is not Hitler—but Christ...
portrait of humanity.

Have you applied minimalism...
to minimalism?

Let us erase it.
What do we have left?

God.

Do I live like a minimalist?
I have a Room & Board dining table—doubles as a desk.
Few chairs—and a Herman Miller.
Dell monitor—a couple-dozen books.
MacBook and accessories...

Is that *minimalism*?

Perhaps, I should show you minimalism.
Cut the chairs...

Man was made to *stand*.

Write on paper...

But, this rhymes with masochism.

No virtue.
