I am the invisible man.

The cute girls—they never notice me!
Just a glance, perhaps, when the crazy man speaks in the subway.
I, armor for society.

How long has it been?
Three years, since I touched a woman.
Oh, if I could die of starvation!

Just a year ago, I tried to kill myself.
The voices told me to walk along the tracks.
But God saved me.

I spent a month in the psychiatric ward.
Three months later, I got a job.
Six months after that, a raise.
In the same time, I lost 40 pounds.

Now, only to navel-gaze?
Dream of a woman’s kiss…
and warm, understanding embrace.

But who can understand me?
Too profound for this world.
Wait for the next, to stand alongside the likes of Plato and Shakespeare…

Speak highly of yourself, that another may not.
Otherwise, you are in his debt.
You shall neither flatter nor raise me.

*I* am the provider of this world.
