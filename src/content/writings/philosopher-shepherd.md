What is the great fallacy of life? It is that "something" is better than "nothing."
Many fall—pursuing the wrong, *knowing* and *deliberate*.

I once loved a woman with ugly heart.
She was my first crush.
For a year, I was obsessed.

I looked around and saw beauty.
But, I could not reach it.
"Too high, too unattainable!"

I knew she was ugly.
I wanted her *for it*—in childish protest.
Oh, false humility!

She treated me cruelly.
Oh, how I deserved it!

But, to fall short on an ideal...
is *far higher*.
This is Christian meekness.

Shall I know Christ?
No, but I may *try*.

I drank for two years—alcoholic.
I protested hard work...
did drugs, too.

Had casual relationships—and...
hurt women.

Knowing the light...
*despising* it.

Why?—"something" beats "nothing."
Oh, how I err!
This—the root of arrogance.

Sigh...
Now, I am more mature.
I protest the Devil.

Shall I have nothing?
Then, so be it.

My past vices—royal, regal purple.
How I loathe them!
For, the King despises his subjects.

I, King over my vice.

But, in the world, I am shepherd...
who loves both his sheep and dogs.

Not a philosopher, King!
