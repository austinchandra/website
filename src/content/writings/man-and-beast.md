Got my first stripe in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu!
Stripes, the pattern on my heart.
Oh, pain and betrayal!

Yet—I must wear them as a tiger.
Ferocious, feline grace.
Some parts of man cannot *tame*.

Lest he become servant or slave...
To God, alone, surrender!

Man is mixture of man and beast.
Christ is mixture of man and God.
The beast, long-tamed...

Look kindly upon us sinners!
