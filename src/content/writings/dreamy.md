12:22PM—and where did I leave you last?—but I have just arrived from my Burger shop, a small not-quite-hole-in-the-wall establishment in Oakland, California, and this piece, shall have a dreamy melody—and my burger sits beside me and cools, while my mind runs hot, so let us begin!

And!—so after the last, did I listen to my Bach, and wander my apartment and get "into" the music, as much as one can!—and I checked my phone, after an hour or two of this, and a friend of mine texted with a question, most profound!

And he asked, but what happens if "someone who knows me not," my words, "looks into my work" and finds judgement about myself?—and he asked this alongside a response to another conversation we had in parallel, about a man whom I should mention in a later work.

But!—I replied first flippantly, and said it is "not my problem," and then I took a shower, and in the hot steamy water, my mind smoked and smoldered, and I realized it was a more profound question than I gave it credit!—and I stepped out, and the mirror was covered, and I found in it a small corner in which I could look at myself, and shave.

For!—I did not bring a razor to my parents', where I had stayed the last day, and I travel light, and besides, I shave daily, and keep the face plain—and I soon dressed, but I did not have clean boxers, since I do my laundry over the weekend, and I skipped this once—and so I wore my jeans commando, and I was grateful!—they use buttons instead of zippers, since they are of Japanese denim made by the best, and they have a small Shop in the Berkeley Marina, and one in Hayes Valley, in San Francisco.

So, thus dressed!—did I respond to him once again, and I told him I must be more "careful" when I speak to him, and I thought about it, and I said that perhaps, if they are kind, they should let me "speak" with them, and if not, what more can I do?

This is, in my work, besides, a chance to get to know me!—but I decided I should lean not on the aspect of artistic expression, but on the straight-spined ideal of Republican character, and it states that this is "how it is," and I aim to be merely the best man, and to make the most of myself that I could.

Thus resolved, did I step out into the rain, a light drizzle, and ponder and wonder upon new ideas, while I walked to the Burger shop, and it goes as such!

But how can conversation change a world!—and it does, for just yesterday, did I explain to my mother the perspective I have on Plato, whom I view as a great Despiser of Mankind, and he is the Philosopher King, so he says, and the King despises his subjects, so I say—and thus, he is most profound in his disdain for the people whom he speaks with!

And thus, may I take an idea from him, that I am King of Philosophers, and I despise my people, if they are the philosophers who came before!—and I am a Philosopher Shepherd, who loves each and every member of his "flock," should I have to elevate myself, in the same tradition, but truly, I care not, anyhow.

And Plato had one great idea!—and it was to show courage for the *sake* of courage, not for any other reason, and for this, do I stand upon firm Red Republican territory, and attempt to revive an ideal long-lost, or perhaps never realized, in the first place.

So!—and now we turn to another hero, for a touch of counterplay, and he is the TechnoKing of his company, and I imagine he must, too, despise his subjects, from what I hear—it is certainly the case, and I should never work for him, despite that I interviewed with StarLink, and found it most interesting!

And he hates the individual, if he loves mankind, and I try to love the individual, and mankind, and despise the "philosopher" and the "artist" and the "designer" and others, in the realms that I declare myself King—and it is for this reason alone!—that I can channel my hatred into something flavorful and productive, for no man is complete without a rich and satisfying array of dislikes and enemies-held-hostage-for-ransom.

This was the first idea!—and the second, was about videogames, and I reflected upon Apex Legends, a deliciously satisfying, frustrating, battle royale—and I spent months playing the game, and I reached the rank of "Diamond," with my Xbox controller, on my Xbox, and I played every game "solo queue," that is with strangers, did I team, and it became so difficult!

For "Diamond" is the top 5%, and at that level, do I play with the professionals, and those are waters unsuited for my tastes!—but in any case, did I take away the following, that the game is equally about positioning and information, the two in counterpoint, and it is not enough to *know* what might happen, but to prepare for it—and it is not enough to prepare for what might happen, without knowing what is likely.

And then, about another game in Cuphead!—and it is counterpoint in the boss-battles and the run-and-gun-tracks, and it is very opposite to the previous, a single-player platform game, and it is about deciphering and understanding patterns!—very pleasing to my mind.

I wonder if there is more to say?—but Walt Disney did give birth to that form of art we call "animation," and I wonder if I feel his touch in Cuphead, even though the 1930s "jazz-style" influence of the latter developed in parallel, and maybe there is something there, but I am not interested.

More interested am I in this burger!—and I hope it has stayed warm enough, and I shall leave my thoughts here complete, and say no more.
