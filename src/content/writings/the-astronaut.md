The astronaut floats weightless in space.

How tenuous his connection to reality!
Just but one cord...

---

Truth is like a spiderweb.
Each thread—gossamer and delicate—connected with the others in intricate pattern.

Fear not the spider!

Marriage is a form of socialism.
He makes and she makes—and both share.

Oh, to tangle threads of truth!
Beautiful, innocent, confusion...

Yet, I would not marry society.

---

What is his cord—but God?
He who knows Christ sees the world stern.

Do you side with a woman?
That is a *casus belli*.
I have parted with "friends" for less.

---

Thus, does the astronaut float—noble, dignified, weightless.
