1:57PM—and my alarm *just* went off, as I got up, for I took a long, extended nap, just now, in the middle of the day, and I woke up with more to say!—and I did not expect it, but here it is, and so let us begin.

Well!—and so I began the day meeting a friend, and we went for a hike in the green, pastoral hills just east of the city, where I lived, and on the way there, we spoke in the car, and I filled him in on many parts of my life and writing I did *not* make explicit, and covered those, again, which indeed I had said out-loud.

And he surprised me!—for he said, at first, that he relates heavily to my work, because he has a high sex-drive, like myself—and I was pleased and mildly shocked, then more so, because he is in a healthy and committed relationship, and I wondered how it could yet be relevant, and he said there were times in which *her* libido came and went.

Oh, goodness gracious!—but this struck fear into me, and the thought that one could be in a partnership whole and healthy, and they had been together for six years and appeared from every angle most strong and stable, yet *still* have issues with libido unfulfilled—but I did not see it coming, and I responded that we were in the "prime" of our lives, as far as libido goes, being currently around 26, and I told him of my "42-and-golden-ratio" sexual theory, which I shall quickly cover.

---

And if 42 is the meaning of life!—but it could be the age of the decline of libido, and if one divides by the golden ratio, to get 26, this may be the peak, and before that, 16, the beginning, and before that still, 10—or the age at which we, in America, teach sexual education in our classrooms.

So!—I explained that I live partially for the present and for the future, and how in my work, sex drives everything, and if there is something I say—or present—that will not "get me laid," in my words, roughly, then I automatically throw it out, and words to similar effect, all true, in any case, which I had perhaps not said explicitly before.

It is a delicate balance!—intellectual structure and principles of morality and "guiding force," and the raw untamed nature of beastly desire, whole and hearty and healthy, and one remembers the distinction—Nietzsche introduced it—of the Apollonian and Dionysian forces, the two in a sort of balance, yet in any case, Nietzsche did not get laid enough, in my opinion.

And I!—enough, and too much, yet not enough, at the same time, and so in talk such as this, did we walk along the trail, and I explained my philosophy behind many parts of my life, and we talked and he listened and we spoke of this topic and that, and let no thought hide unfiltered, but let nature and her clean, pristine morning air, catch and judge each one of our feelings, for God alone may weigh and judge the character of man.

So!—we passed the morning pastoral, and then we returned and tried, for the first time, for myself, and for him, a new Brunch spot, Italian-but-mostly-American, fare just down the street from my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym!

And—I ordered us meatballs to share, drenched and drowning in sauce, too much, too much!—yet it was the right amount, and I got eggs-benedict-over-pastrami, delicious red meat as the carpet beneath the eggs, and he got fried-chicken-waffles, hearty and healthy in proportion, with a tower of fruit.

We chatted of this and that—and I remember not the details, but it was pleasant, and it was a "nice time," and some details of talk between friends, should stay between friends, in any case, and the world need not to know every word said in confidence, in trust!

Not so much philosophy in this one, perhaps, but just a moment, just a morning, with a Rustic simplicity, taking care of oneself and friends—and what more can one do, in this life, that is so much higher, anyways?
