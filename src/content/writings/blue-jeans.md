Oh, and I tire!
This writing and thought makes a mess of a man.

Take refuge in blue jeans and ice cream...
Sturdy, starchy Japanese denim—but an ocean on my legs.
Sips and nibbles of melting ice cream, earl grey and lavender.

Hide from a world cold and watching.
Now, back to my attire...

---

I began writing to share with the world a piece of my heart.
But—also, to distract myself from another project...

My clothing designs!—where did I leave you, but a week ago?

And, I eat of the world, and digest, and—yes—*shit*.
You readers, foolish pigs, wallow in it.
Each of my thoughts, muddy and pristine, like a newspaper from my mind.

Fit equally for toilet paper—and inspiration.

---

So, I leave you here, dear reader.
Maybe, another day, we meet again...

This artist *finishes* what he starts.
No, I have not forgotten...

And, I have more, after the attire—and the thought makes me numb!
Too much to do, too little time.

---

And—all I wanted was to play *Elden Ring*.
But, my parents raised me well, who said not to "play until work is done."

What a lifetime of work before me!
Oh, humbling—and to climb a mountain, one realizes, brings him to the base of another!

Thus, it is project after project—and I would have quit writing a long time ago.
But, for a friend who encouraged me to continue.

---

Alright!—I have dropped a bomb, and let there be silence.
I must move on and forwards...

Earn my video-game, some time in 2027, or later.
Time is ticking!
