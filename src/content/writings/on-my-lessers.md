For, I have not yet paid all of my debts, and if I am first among philosophers, I am closely followed by Nietzsche and Plato, so let me correct their images.

---

Nietzsche, oh brave and fiery soul.
Did he dislike the world around him!

How noble, the image of a solitary man in profound contemplation.
But—one develops philosophy with friends, or not at all.

And how he disliked the sciences!
How he said, paraphrasing, that "among them, is psychology *queen*."
Then, let me complete the thought, "...and art is *king*, to whom she belongs."

For beyond law and language and thought is art—alone, universal.
Or, does it attempt to be...

The golden appreciation of the Greeks—Nietzsche was right, here, and we turn to Plato.
Ah, profound *despiser* of humanity, who makes Nietzsche look a child!

He who preaches aristocracy—and who lies to his people.
Does he swear the aristocratic oath: "never shall I *lower* myself!"?
Do some, today—tangent, forgive me—swear the technological oath: "never shall I betray *progress*!"?

Well, let me break in half the noble lie.
Do our Founding Fathers say, "All Men are Created Equal"—and in this, perhaps, I do not paraphrase?

Before God, it is true, if not in the world of man.
Yet, Plato lies empty and vacuous.
Does he share, and share *more*, classes and hierarchies of men, exclusive and rigid?

But, I say let a man move among the ranks with graceful step—and in all, may he see the common thread of humanity.
What a majestic pattern, denied and rejected, by this oldest of thinkers.

And I swear no oath, nor fealty, but to God alone, who cares not for words and well-wishing.

Does he imagine his society blind—and himself the one-eyed king?

For, no King loves his subjects but despises them, and I am King of philosophers, and I despise mine—but among the people, I am a shepherd, who loves dog and sheep alike, and who walks peaceful and unpretentious.

Oh, it is mere analogy, for artistic sake!—just to break a King, a play-pretend, for I am the victor and the conquerer who comes back with the heads of my enemies, marble busts cracked and yellowed with age, whom I have weighed and showed lacking.

---

But, my society shall have two eyes—and I, if I am lucky, shall let them guide me to greater and higher fruits, for I do nothing, nor pursue anything, but what those around me suggest.
And I am a sheep!—and highest of sheep, and yet am I higher than these your heroes, so let them all fall to the ground and break, idols casted aside, swept away for greater truths.

---

I alone respect myself, who loves God!
