Consider "the pie"—a ring comprised of triangles.

Take two opposing slices.
This is tension, dynamic inverses held in sustained balance.

What is the *triangle*?
It is one idea—developed across levels.

---

Let us cook a steak.
The idea is carnal, hedonistic red meat.
Bloody and joyous...

Let it speak!—and make it salty as possible.
For, salt is the seasoning of life.
As Lot's virtuous wife—who turned to salt, not to ash.

Balance it with butter, garlic, and herbs, the supporting cast.
Too salty?—mellow it *elsewhere*.

Never to compromise!

Make the potatoes richer, the wine subtler...
*Distract* your audience!

"Look here, no there..."

Let them eventually realize—*all is the same idea*.
Because they are different, they are one.

The sides play triangles in this ring of a dish.

---

Let us design a logo.

Each element must speak for itself!
And, play sharp foil to the others.

Temper a bright blue—with a brighter *pink*.
Contrast both with a soft white.

Never to diminish.
Everything—strong and *opinionated*.

---

Does it sound familiar?—this is Hegelian dialectic, or Bach's counterpoint.
Oh, dark German spirit!

Consider, the description of this site.

“Day ends in night, and with it, time to reflect—musings tinted twilight, hues of darkness and shadow, light known and forgotten…”

The idea?—"Musing, Eternal."
How do I develop it?

Place eternal philosophy in the context of transient day and night.
Make us feel our *mortality*!

Two raging opposites—unified in conflict.
Besides, I pay my spiritual debts to the Germans.

Hamlet has two choices.

One—he sees his father suffered his sins.
Thus, shall his uncle.

Two—he asks how far the plot *goes*.
He speaks to the apothecary.
Who sold Claudius the poison?
Who is *involved*?

Then, he cleans house.

"In this Kingdom, there shall be no villainy but *mine*!"

Is it only Claudius?
Oh, how simple.

---

The triangle separates layers of abstraction.

“George Washington inspired troops of humble origin with dreams of revolution.”

Did he *win*?
Everyone knows that.

What made them humble?
Nobody cares...

---

Separate code across abstraction barriers!

Let one function, one level—one object, the same.
They must interact *appropriately*—using an API.

Do not violate these boundaries.
Rude, *brutish*...

Never to confuse principles!
But—use the same ideas from top-to-bottom.

What is the *soul* of a codebase?
Performance?
Simplicity?
Correctness...

Let these fight violent rage.

Do not mix patterns or idioms—one idea, one execution!

---

Do money markets trend towards signal?
Why?

Because, as Hayek described, individuals seek to maximize profit.
Collectively, we make efficient use of information.

Does the moral arc bend towards justice?
The moral market is *similar*.

Is morality an open question, changing with the times?
Thus—we favor liberty.

---

What is at the center of the pie?

God, who finds expression where one *searches*.
May we slowly discover...

---

I said I was done.
But, let me make it a baker's dozen.

If God rests, man does not.
