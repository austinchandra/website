Now, dear reader, I hope you shall forgive this writer his indulgence into his heart of hearts.

For writing, to me, is like therapy—and I sit down with one rich, unrelenting emotion, and I write and write until I clear the slate of my heart.
Like the graceful athletes!—who leave it all on the field, I know I am done when the heart feels calm and prepared for the next.
And the topic of today is heartbreak...

For, once I knew a woman—a girl, at the time, and I a boy—whom I adored dearly!

For a year, did we chat, friends sometimes, and did I imagine, other times slightly more—and so I asked her to the dance, and she agreed!
Oh, how nervous I was—how I wondered and wondered what to do, and what to say.

And now, since I am no yarn-spinner—having prepared you for what happens, let us collapse this story before becomes heavy and emotional.

So, did we meet at the dance, and she asked for her ticket, and I gave it—to see her spend the night with her friends.
Did she say a word to me!—perhaps, a short "thank you," and I, who spent the night lonely and confused upon the bleachers.

Twelve years later, and I—still a slave to the memory.
What is woman, this creature, who can cause a heart such boundless pain?

Thus, do I look upon her humbly.
I am not a man?—but then, may I be a beast or a slave, something alive?
Or, am I better off dead?

---

For, I have deep and strong feelings—and my politics incline conservative, rich and bloody as a cut of steak.
Do I suppose I can help being right—and being *superior*?

Yet, even my friends and family, knowing perhaps not the inner workings of my heart, say that those of my kind—may be better off this planet.
Oh, pathetic sin!—and so, I refrain from voting.
What man should I be—to present my family with a tangled problem of reconciliation, to make sense of one who is simultaneously brother and son and dreaded enemy?

I am the soft, gentle nightmare of your peaceful dreams, who shall till the garden of humanity until it sprouts lush green soul, fertilized from the depths of my eternal spirit.

Oh, I wish you could see inside my soul!
For, in my heart is a garden of Eden—and when I put the words onto paper, everything comes in contact with this most foul of worlds.
