3PM now, twelve hours after I first began the day, exhausted and strained.
For, I have come after all my enemies—and conquered!—and delivered secrets and principles and guiding wisdom, and I am spent.

What more do I have to say?
Nobody in this wide world, perhaps, shall share my appreciation for counterpoint, shall care and love and obsess over it as much as I—and this is the loneliness I inherit from the lot God allocated for me.

---

So, I shall summarize with three guiding laws, for morality is just as immortal as physics, and more so—for it lasts as long as humanity, and physics may change, should the world prove a simulation, and like Newton, do I deliver light!

And on liberty, the principles are as follows:
1. Arm Yourself
2. Pay your Sins in Blood
3. Turn your Sins to Strengths

The details, in the preceding piece—and for myself, I shall move forwards, and this raging fire in my schizophrenic mind shall cool, having found its vent and outlet in creative destruction, and architecture of society, design of the modern world.

---

And it is to my projects, I shall turn, having written and said my piece to this world—first, my clothes, then my bridge.
In time, shall God smile upon me, may I find a cute blonde princess to make my wife, and if not, I shall find a way to pay my amends forwards.

---

May love and peace prosper!—and for black ego, one last reward, for I wrote and published my first piece 12 days ago, and this is "twelve days of writing."
And like Christ, who had twelve apostles, do I appreciate a dozen—nice round, human number, and I, who in twelve days, put to shame our literary tradition, and brought it back elevated and secure.

Blessed is this race, who accepts me in its ranks.
