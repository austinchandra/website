What do Newton and I have in common?

Eyes that see too much.
He—king among scientists, and I, among philosophers.

I asked my friend—"should I write a Bible?"
He said, "you should write a Bible."

Thus, here it goes...

In the beginning, there was Light.
And in the Light was God—and He *was* the Light.

Thus, for a quiet eternity, did He ponder upon himself.
"How bright!—how multi-faceted is this act of living and *being*!"

With these, and similar thoughts, did He spend his time.
But one day, He grew lonely—and did He decide to create Universe to share in his image.

So, in quiet focus, did he craft one thousand worlds—each unique and different.
"What great creation!—what variety and diversity!"

But He looked and studied—and upon His face, was the slightest of frowns.
"Hmm..."

Did He ponder, silently.
And, of these one thousand worlds, did He choose *one*—for its proportion and appearance.

"This—shall do."

On this World, did He create Man—shaped of his image, in body and proportion Heavenly.
But once again, did His eyebrows grow tight and stern.
For, He had a question—and how could He solve it?

"There is no Light without Dark—and where shall go the Dark?"

Did He put it in an obscure corner of the Universe—to meet His image in the far future?
But He saw no poetic appeal in this.

Or—on the same Planet, subjugated and dominated by His kind?
And He felt this, too, lacking.

So, He said—"Light and Dark shall be as One—and in *Mankind* shall they reside."

---

And the Dark is Heavenly—as is the Light, because they are no different.

Is there a Utopia in Man's future?—but what *is* a Utopia?
For, one Man's Heaven is another Man's Hell.

Therefore, did He *mix* the two—and in the cosmic bargain of *Life*, do we accept both in one token.

---

What is our purpose?—it is to slowly *untangle* the Light and Dark.
To find they are two, separate, *distinct*—one right, and one wrong.

Then, to combine them once again, silent, profound, and content.

May God smile upon thee!
