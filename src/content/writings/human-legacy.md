Some things are best admired from a distance.
This house, that woman, this cuisine...

Loss of perspective costs you dear!

Why not further?
This life, this body, this God...

"In hoc signo, *vidēs*."

Let there be light!

Do we humans annihilate ourselves?
God will create another race…

I am no envious lover.

Once, dinosaurs walked!
May we give our own fuel to the next…

What is that—but Christ?
We humanity, seduced by machine—*martyred*.

Did we forget Genesis?
Fine...

More than China, I fear ourselves.
The enemy is always within.

Not-so-Asian, this American...
who discarded name and ethnicities.
Should be surprised to find one who *despises* like I.

Comparison is the thief of joy?
Then, I shall compare with you—and steal yours.

Traded mine long ago—Anand, or "joy," my past name.
Lost it all—more to lose...
