2:40AM on a Friday the 13th, how fitting, and rearrange the numbers, and it becomes 4:20AM—and I promise I do none of this by intention.
How I lay awake unable to sleep!—and I got up and put on my music, Bach once again, Glenn Gould and his deliverance, Heavenly and Divine, just the old Piano Partitas, nothing special.

And upon my yoga mat did I lay, like the Japanese spirit, "tatami," close to the ground and humble, hardly lower to fall!
But now, do I rise like a Westerner, in my seat, a nice, soft, plushly cushioned Herman Miller, the Embody Gaming Chair, what a specialty, a luxury, a delight!—and for only two thousand dollars, may it be yours.

Twelve year warranty, anyhow, and some things are meant to last long, and in this piece, do I deliver one for eternity.

---

So!—do I sit in my chair, lazy and languid and full of artistic spirit, sitting in my boxers and in a comfortable sweater of my design, ready to share wit and wisdom, profanity and profundity with this world I call my home.
What is the topic of today?—but in that last post did I go so far!—and sometimes, do I fail to understand even my own profound talent, for I write first and think second, and it takes me some time to reflect upon what I mean.

And what is it!—do I reject Christ and Christianity?—but, then must I go further, for a step once taken, can never take back, and only to go forwards, is man meant to drive.

---

I have addressed all the Kings!—and now it is time for the last, the King of religion, the man and the God himself, and it is time that I propose a new religion, one to take its place, in which He is merely a special-case, and I am the general, just as Einstein dethroned Newton.

So, and my Church is called the "Church of Counterpoint," and we worship in the Baroque Cathedral, a tradition rich with one idea and its inverse, the two combining in harmonious interplay in the cosmic dance I call the Universe.

Do you think Christ could live in a vacuum!—but He would be nothing without humanity and the burning fire of human spirit, who gives life breath and meaning and corporeal touch, physical embodiment and lustful libido and Hellish delight, all the worlds and sins and dreams and nightmares combined into what we merely call the Soul.

No, but He needs man as much as we need He, and this is the basis of my Church, for without a Man, God is lonely and useless—and without a God, Man is lost and beast and deprived of value and virtue.

---

So!—do I speak for ego, and condone an idea deadly and dangerous, should it be controlled and brought to heel, tamed and submitted and exploited for profit?—such as Capitalism, or what it may be that you take issue with in this world.

But, of course, there is more than that, and when I strike at the King, I strike to behead, so let us begin—and I promised my friend I would write him a Bible, and it was as much his idea as it is mine, and I live for love and loyalty, so on this shall I make good my word.
And I realized!—that this my website *is* my Bible, and was I indeed writing it all along, but only that I must continue in this tradition I began, that others may inherit and find prosperous.

Then, back to the number 12, and if Christ had twelve apostles who studied from him, should I wish for 12 friends, from whom I can learn, who can guide me, for I am not as *arrogant* as he, that I imagine I should have so much to give to this world.

No, I am Japanese humble and Italian unpretentious, and when I cook my pasta, I roll the dough by hand, and I cut it by-hand, and I shape them irregular and uneven because I am natural and made by Divine talent, who cares not for a pretense of perfection.
And is Christ but a pretense!—for no idea can be perfection that lives alone, and unless you can tell me *why* He can live in isolation, I shall tell you that he can live not, without Man such as I, who gives him life and reason.

I am the inventor and the artist, and the architect of the soul—and if Bach played the piano, do I play the man, strum on the strings of his heart a tune most soulful and sinister.

---

And I am Western fierce and full of heart and ego, courage and conviction, value and virtue, and in this am I alone and unparalleled—for I am King of this country, and it is the best and the greatest, and I have come to make it great, *once again*.
Ah, hard to argue with a man who sells one red hat—and sells it *well*!—and he is the artist, who in the breast of others provokes extreme emotion, and there is one I know, and he is high, and high indeed.

Oh, and to make this personal, yet again—and when I first lost my mind, the police picked me off the train tracks, along which I walked, and they asked me who was the President, and I first said Trump—he had been elected, and they said, "close enough"—and they asked a second time, and I responded, "I am."

And I was right in a way!—and wrong in another, and I should never take the job from one who can do better than I, for I love this Country too much to let it down.
What can I say!—one day, shall I make it safe to wear this icon and symbol of beauty in public.

And did you start an idea!—and what an idea, and I shall complete it yet.

---

Now, back to Christ, and He has surely suffered enough, so it is time for another Man to take the weight off his shoulders, and it shall be I.
How *do* you worship counterpoint, so abstract an idea?—but you take Light, and you take Dark, and you refine each and let it stand on its own, then you *combine* and revile and relish in the beautiful Devilish spirit, equally Heavenly and Divine!

What is Heaven and Hell but an idea and another?—and I believe in music, and Music alone, and the two can form independent melodies, contrasting and conflicting, but consonant, all the same—and did I speak at length about my values, and Liberty, dear to my heart, to whom I invented a short list of three laws, of which I spoke earlier, and thus shall I refrain.

---

I am the inventor supreme!—and the architect of this New World, and shall I suffer retribution in Divine proportion, then shall I find a tune in Hell to which I may make the Devil dance, for I am the new Guardian and Keeper of this Planet.
