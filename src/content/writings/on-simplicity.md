This is a discussion on simplicity.

---

Rust and Go.

Is Rust the more perfect language?
No jittery garbage collection—and stronger type guarantees.

But, in Go, you never read a macro...
What abomination to poetic eyesight!

---

Helvetica.

Helvetica, "King of Fonts."
How can you argue with Swiss geometric perfection?

From Latin, "Helvetia," the soul of neutrality.

Is it harder to read?
Fine...

---

AI.

Oh, autistic savants.
Here comes atavistic conservative, to argue for better days.

Remember old Bayes?
What is the probability our emotions are *right*?
How about—given we survived countless cycles of evolution?

Not even natural intelligence, do I argue for, but natural *folly*.

To err, to laugh, to sin.
Where shall it go—in autistic paradise?
Our bodies, infinitely more efficient at processing information, than our minds.

What hubris!—to think the brain does anything.
Maybe, a comment, here and there.
Classic liberal nonsense—"the Government is in charge."

No, I am the body and the people.
Everything, from bounteous nature derived.

---

Just, know I am your enemy.
And, when you sleep, I watch.

Let my ghost haunt you at each mistake.
Never a moment of peace!

---

Nor, shall I dress you with laurels.
You are neither scientist nor industrialist—but somewhere in-between.

The greats of humanity have come and gone.
There is no place for you among those ranks.
Cursed be thy name!

Let us remember those who sold humanity for a paycheck.

---

What shall you buy?
Nothing of mine—except a morsel of my spirit.
The last remnant of divine grace for failed mankind.

For, I shall forgive you, still.

---

Who can fault a man for his ignorance?
God knows I have sinned.
To Him, shall I turn, light in conscience and spirit.

Where, then, shall you go?

---

To your God?
Oh!—how Heavenly.
