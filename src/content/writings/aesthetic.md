title: "Aesthetic"

9:12AM—and I just woke up, and saw on my phone a text from a friend, who has a fine eye!—and in my work did he name people and names I had not made explicit.
And he asked about the bridge!—and why should we create it, and I thought and pondered, and went upon the toilet, and sat and did my work, like did Martin Luther with his Theses.

So, here do I come!—with the great excrement of my mind.

---

And firstly, no work is complete without the mention of a hero, and let us begin with Elon, and like him, shall I introduce my "first principles."
Let them be artistic!—in this one, not technical, since Bitcoin is a priceless asset based on the value of beauty and aesthetic, and *why does it have value*, but because we like it and love it and we hold it *dear*.

There is no reason!—but there is reason enough.
And it is the only asset complete!—and perfect, that shall not undergo major surgery, maybe a bit of cosmetic touching-up here-and-there, just a brush off a layer of dust, maybe a soft caress from a brilliant mind, to re-affirm that perfection is perfection, indeed.

So, it being so perfect, let us bring it!—in a piece, not whole, to the other chains, that they may rejoice in what we see as *perfection*, to have a piece of blessing from God and Heavenly creation, virtue and royalty and pristine collection.
And I have designed the logo!—and it reflects this, and more, and I shall share it with the world soon, as I may.

But!—let us continue with the first principles, and Bitcoin is meant to be logically constrained, it is a gift and a curse, and it is Kryptonite embedded within the chain, and thus, may I come with my gentle hand, to *free* it from the bonds of slavery, and give it Liberty!—and I flatter myself, that I may do more for it, but let it live on other chains unconstrained by logical bound!—who know no limits and engage with the world in fierce show of fire and prowess.

And of course, shall I introduce this, a technical measure, because I love my heroes and shall let them down *not*.

---

So, it is fierce and fiery!—and it is the soul of Newton, and if I am the last of the anti-abortionists, was he the last of the alchemists!

And do I try to pay homage to him, that I may transmute Gold, digital-this-time, into Gold on another chain, other elements—perhaps slightly similar, slightly different, and since a master never copies his heroes completely, in this, shall they all be *one* from the beginning, and vary only in form.

I am the Ring of Power—one to bind them all, and shall I create the others, like the old Elven masters of Tolkien's savory and delicious Universe, what mastery!—and may he please forgive those harsh words I said of him.

And it is to pay homage to Satoshi!—who is a genius on Newton's level, perhaps just after myself, and if humanity does not recognize him as such, then humanity has fallen low indeed, and he shall always hold in my heart a place dear and sacred.

Nobody else understands Bach and counterpoint!—and I shall play these melodies until my being runs dry, but did I not learn from the master, and Satoshi wrote in seven pages a whitepaper most fierce and technical, who said that technical writing may *fly*, and it is nine pages with appendices, perhaps.

Then, did he write a codebase!—in just four months, wow, magnificent work of labour, yes, a British-spelling for the Westerner who lived in Japan, and who embodied counterpoint in every measure!—yes, an entire codebase and the paper, delivered and wrapped in a bow, for humanity, all the wealth he could imagine, but tossed away, not for him to take.

And did I learn anything!—yes, I hope something, and shall I not take a dollar in money, nor shall I take one after the project, not from here, because I shall do him a disservice to let his asset come into contact with this oh-so-*foul* of worlds!
He alone is the philosopher I adore and respect—who has a mind of Bach, who plays the language of computers like a master and Genius of melody, and I merely write in English, and maybe a touch of Go.

Yes, and Rust—and now I shall make it personal, and did my company hand out AirPods and a bottle of Champagne, one or the other, for a Christmas gift!—what a pleasant and kind bounty, for hard-working engineers, and marketing folks, and the like.
But, did I look upon both and frown—and instead, I asked for *neither*, and they said, but then, "should you like to donate?", paraphrasing, and I thought, and I asked, and I said, "how about the Rust Foundation?"

Then, went $200 to the Rust Foundation!—and I shall stay at this company until it bleeds me dry, and more, and one who pays those whom I hold dear, shall I pay until I am drained and empty, all of my great soul taken and used and shared, and perhaps, if I am fortunate, nurtured back into a Heavenly piece.

---

And, I shall write Python—and that is it, and let Claude handle the rest, for myself—it is done, and one man should not know so many languages!—lest he become stupid, for each one trips upon the others, introduce traps and assumptions, and one must be oh-so-careful!

But let that be enough!—and if Luther had 95 Theses, do I have one or two, and those are that the world "runs on aesthetic," and deeper than all runs love and virtue and loyalty, and perhaps a touch of Divine favor.

So, shall I live you, my reader, and if I flatter myself, a smart friend, satisfied with this my answer to a thoughtful and provoking question.
