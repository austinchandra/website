What *is* the meaning of it all? Life and the Universe. Is it, as Adams suggests, 42?
There is something there.

42 is the age libido declines. 26, it peaks. 16, it develops. 10, it begins.
Each stage—in golden ratio of the previous.

What is life, but to reproduce?
For, libido serves to procreate—to make *more* of life.

Did not Satan, as a Serpent, seduce Eve?
He convinced her to *eat* fruit, not to bear it.
How foul!
May we say fruitless sex is—*fruitless*?

Does humanity represent the tree?
We, modernity, have fallen far.
The "information" age?
Oh, vain mockery.
We merely *industrialize* bytes.

Soon, may we forget to think...

How about the Universe? But, a study of quantum physics suggests doubt.
Why does it matter if *we* observe?

Oh, lowly creatures.
Perhaps it is a clue—do we matter *so much*?
Then, the Universe cannot be true.

The answer may not be 42—but 4D.
Did an alien race in 4-dimensions—create our world?
How would we ever know?

Perhaps, string theory is *right*.
But, we may never prove it.

In turn, we may sigh defeat and create a 2D simulation.
Why not 3D?
But—we lack the laws.

Create new creatures who worship us.

Does one say Spinoza was *wrong*?
"God is Perfect"—noble lie?
No, God *is* perfect, but the aliens...

There is chance for wit.
Does the Universe cool?
Let us plant a hard-drive on Earth.
In it, all of our knowledge—and wipe everything else clean.

The alien comes to inspect...
"Hmm, zero, zero, zero... oh, by Golly!"

Where does that leave us? No better than we started.
But, no worse.

Still, we serve Christ—and suffer, that He may *not*.
