Design is a lost art.
Nobody *thinks* about it, anymore.

I designed this site carefully.
Each ratio, measured and proportionate.

Top : Left : Right margins—in the Golden Ratio.
Right : Width—in the Golden Ratio on Desktop.
For tablets, the Golden Ratio squared, and for mobile, cubed.

Everything I see is flat and plain.
Where is the *asymmetry*?
Higher than balance is imbalance.

Right and wrong are *not* equal!
Or, did Christ suffer for your follies...

The right margin is greater than the left, because right is *higher* than left.
So, knew the Romans—for "sinistrum" is left, in Latin, root for "sinister."

How I *despise* the left-handed.
Da Vinci cannot compare to myself.
Does he know a woman—who knows what man does not?
I know a *man*...

Ah, wondrous origin of the Universe.

In Japan, one may learn design.
The Eastern Aesthetic—how infallible!
Nobody knows *scorn* like an Asian.
The designer—most spiteful of all.

Where is the *artist*?
Consumed by a world who loves him not...
Everything "bland" and "safe"—like a bowl of oatmeal.

Thus, I come to speak some sense...
